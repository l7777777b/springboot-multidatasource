# Working spring boot multiple datasource implementation
Currently using mysql database with single table called "user".

Schema can be created manually by looking at domain "user" class.

The config classes can be modified and extended to have more than 2 datasource.

Another type of database such as sql server or postgresql also supported by changing the configuration (.yml) file.
